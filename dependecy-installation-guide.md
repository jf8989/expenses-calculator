## 📌 For Cloning & Setting Up a Python Project

This guide walks you through setting up a Python project after cloning it from a repository.

---

## 📌 1. Check for Required Software
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the necessary tools installed.

### ✅ Check if Python is Installed
Run the following command:
```sh
python --version
```
or
```sh
python3 --version
```
If Python is **not installed**, download and install it from:
🔗 [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

⚠️ Ensure that `pip` is installed and available. Run:
```sh
pip --version
```
If `pip` is missing, install it using:
```sh
python -m ensurepip --default-pip
```

### ✅ Check if Git is Installed
Run:
```sh
git --version
```
If not installed, download it from:
🔗 [Git Official Website](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

---

## 📌 2. Clone the Repository
Navigate to the folder where you want to clone the project:
```sh
cd /path/to/your/projects
```
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
```
Move into the project folder:
```sh
cd your-repo-name
```

---

## 📌 3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It’s recommended to use a **virtual environment** to keep dependencies isolated.

### ✅ Create a Virtual Environment
Run:
```sh
python -m venv venv
```
This creates a folder `venv` inside your project.

### ✅ Activate the Virtual Environment
#### **Windows (PowerShell)**
```sh
venv\Scripts\Activate
```
#### **Mac/Linux**
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```
After activation, you should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

---

## 📌 4. Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is active, install the required dependencies.
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs everything listed in `requirements.txt`.

💡 **If the `requirements.txt` file is missing**, you might need to manually install dependencies:
```sh
pip install flask requests numpy  # Example packages
```
Then save them to a new `requirements.txt`:
```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

## 📌 5. Verify Installation
Check if all dependencies were installed correctly:
```sh
pip list
```
or check a specific package:
```sh
pip show flask
```

---

## 📌 6. Run the Project
Most Python projects can be started with:
```sh
python app.py
```
Or if using Flask:
```sh
flask run
```
If the project has a `README.md`, check for specific run instructions.

---

## 📌 7. Deactivate the Virtual Environment (Optional)
When you're done, exit the virtual environment:
```sh
deactivate
```
You can reactivate it later using `venv\Scripts\Activate` (Windows) or `source venv/bin/activate` (Mac/Linux).

---

## 📌 8. Keeping Dependencies Up to Date
Whenever new dependencies are added to the project, update `requirements.txt`:
```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
When pulling updates from the repository, always run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to ensure you have the latest dependencies.
